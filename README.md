# Coursera-Practical-Machine-Learning-Final-Project

## Description of Model 

Cross-validation was performed by subsampling the training data set randomly without replacement into 2 subsamples: subTraining data (75% of the original Training data set) and subTesting data (25%). These models will be fitted on the subTraining data set, and tested on the subTesting data. Once the most accurate model is choosen (decision tree versus random foresting), it will be tested on the original Testing data set.
